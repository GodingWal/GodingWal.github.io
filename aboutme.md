My name is Goding Wal. I'm from Southern Minnesota, Albert Lea to be exact. I am currently in my pursuit of a BA in economics and minor in business. I work at Brakebush in Wells, MN , where I am a lead. Seeing how they have automated a lot of process sparked my interest in data science. Particulary machine learning. Using that to do Predicative Maintenance could be a game changer for the companies and others who choose to pursue that path.
